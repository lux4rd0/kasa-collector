## About The Project

<center><img src="https://labs.lux4rd0.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kasa_collector_header.png"></center>

**Kasa Collector** is a set of scripts deployed with Docker that collects data from [Kasa](https://www.kasasmart.com/us/products/smart-plugs) Smart Plugs. Once deployed, you can visualize that data using Grafana dashboards.

A live set of dashboards using this Collector [are available](https://labs.lux4rd0.com/kasa-collector/) for you to try out.

## Getting Started

The project uses a Docker container that may be configured to accept different settings for how often you wish to poll your Kasa devices.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)
- [InfluxDB V2](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2/)
- [Grafana 11.0.0](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/)

## Supported Kasa Smart Plugs

This project currently supports collecting data from the Kasa [KP115](https://www.kasasmart.com/us/products/smart-plugs/kasa-smart-plug-slim-energy-monitoring-kp115) smart plug device and Kasa [HS300](https://www.kasasmart.com/us/products/smart-plugs/kasa-smart-wi-fi-power-strip-hs300) power strip. These are the two devices that I have - others may be supported based on the "energy" tag found during device disovery.

## TPLink Smartplug Open Source Project

This project uses the python-kasa module to discover and connect to Kasa devices. More details on supported devices may be found on their [project site](https://github.com/python-kasa/python-kasa).

## Deploying Kasa Collector

Use the following [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/lux4rd0/kasa-collector):

```plaintext
lux4rd0/kasa-collector:2.0.06
lux4rd0/kasa-collector:latest
```

Kasa Collector requires some environmental variables for the container to function. It mainly needs details on your InfluxDB instance (Bucket, Org, Token, and URL).

You can start the container with something similar to the example `docker-compose.yaml` file:

```yaml
name: kasa-collector

services:
  kasa-collector:
    container_name: kasa-collector
    environment:
      KASA_COLLECTOR_INFLUXDB_BUCKET: kasa
      KASA_COLLECTOR_INFLUXDB_ORG: Lux4rd0
      KASA_COLLECTOR_INFLUXDB_TOKEN: TOKEN
      KASA_COLLECTOR_INFLUXDB_URL: http://influxdb.lux4rd0.com:8086
      TZ: America/Chicago
    image: lux4rd0/kasa-collector:latest
    network_mode: host
    restart: always
```

Or use this example docker run command:

```bash
docker run -d \
      --name=kasa-collector \
      -e KASA_COLLECTOR_INFLUXDB_BUCKET=kasa \
      -e KASA_COLLECTOR_INFLUXDB_ORG=Lux4rd0 \
      -e KASA_COLLECTOR_INFLUXDB_TOKEN=TOKEN \
      -e KASA_COLLECTOR_INFLUXDB_URL=http://influxdb.lux4rd0.com:8086 \
      -e TZ=America/Chicago \
      --restart always \
      --network host \
      lux4rd0/kasa-collector:latest
```

Be sure to change your InfluxDB details and timezone in the environmental variables.

Running `docker-compose up -d` or the `docker run` command will download and start up the kasa-collector container.

## Collector Details

#### kasa-collector

Kasa Collector is the primary data collector and is responsible for gathering details per Kasa device for the following:

* Current (milliamps)
* Voltage (millivolts)
* Power (milliwatts)
* Total Watt Hours

Additional details like Wifi RSSI signal strength, device and plug names, and device details are also collected.

## Grafana Dashboards

Collecting data is only half the fun. Now it's time to provision some Grafana Dashboards to visualize your essential Kasa data. You'll find a [folder of dashboards](https://github.com/lux4rd0/kasa-collector/dashboards) with collectors and backends split out. You can also use the links/numbers next to each dashboard title to load the dashboards [directly from Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards?search=kasa%20collector).

### In General:

Each dashboard has dropdowns at the top that allow you to filter measurements based on devices and plugs. The dropdowns default to "All," but you can select and save preferences.

**Interval**:  A dropdown that provides different smoothing levels helps manage how the graphs look based on the interval of data collected by the Kasa Collector. Think of this as a level of "smoothing" based on your chosen time frame and the polling time you're collecting data. Be sure to set these to a time frame higher than your poll rate.

**Time Range**: This defaults to "Today so far" but can be updated to any other Relative or Absolute time range. To smooth out any data, change the "Interval" dropdown for longer time ranges.

**Dashboard Refresh**: Each dashboard is set to refresh every sixty seconds, but this can be changed or disabled.

### Kasa Collector - Energy (By Measurement) - [14762](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/14762)

<center><img src="https://labs.lux4rd0.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kasa_collector-energy_by_measurement.jpg"></center>

### Kasa Collector - Energy (By Device) - [14772](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/14772)

<center><img src="https://labs.lux4rd0.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kasa_collector-energy_by_device.jpg"></center>

The Energy dashboard provides panels representing Power, Watt-Hours, Current, and Voltage. Measurements are at the top for total combined information (and voltage average) and rows for both devices and plugs (as part of power strips). You can use the device and plug dropdown menus at the top of the dashboard to filter on each. If you choose a single device that happens to be a power strip, only the plugs for that power strip will be shown in the Plugs dropdown.

## Grafana Datasource

This collector uses InfluxQL, and for the dashboards to function, you need to create a data source in Grafana using the credentials you set in InfluxDB V2. More details can be found on the InfluxDB V2 Web site:

https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2/tools/grafana/?t=InfluxQL#configure-your-influxdb-connection

The biggest change here is:

 - Configure InfluxDB authentication:
   
   **Token authentication**
   Under **Custom HTTP Headers**, select **Add Header**. Provide your InfluxDB API token:
   
   **Header**: Enter `Authorization`
   
   **Value**: Use the `Token` schema and provide your InfluxDB API token. For example:
   
       Token y0uR5uP3rSecr3tT0k3n

## Troubleshooting

**Error Messages**

Sometimes, you'll see the following error message from the Kasa Collector:

```plaintext
kasa_request_info: malformed JSON, retrying
```

This is because some devices that respond to the collector might be malformed data. The collector will try again until a good response is received.
